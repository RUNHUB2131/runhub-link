# Chat Notification Integration

## Overview

We have successfully integrated the chat notification system with the synchronized notification system in RUNHUB Connect. This ensures that chat messages now create notifications in the main notification bell while keeping the separate chat indicator working independently.

## What We Implemented

### 1. Database Trigger for Chat Notifications

**File**: `supabase/migrations/20240402000000_add_chat_notifications.sql`

- Created a database trigger `on_chat_message_sent` that fires when new chat messages are inserted
- The trigger creates notifications in the main `notifications` table with type `'new_chat'`
- Notifications include:
  - Sender's name (brand company name or run club name)
  - Truncated message content (max 100 characters)
  - Application ID as `related_id` for proper navigation
  - Recipient is determined as the opposite party in the chat

### 2. Enhanced Notification Service

**File**: `src/services/notificationService.ts`

- Added `markChatNotificationsAsRead()` function to mark all chat notifications for a specific application as read
- This function is called when a user opens a chat to clear related notifications

### 3. Updated Notification Hook

**File**: `src/hooks/useNotifications.tsx`

- Added `markChatAsRead()` function that uses the new service function
- Provides optimistic updates to the React Query cache
- Exported for use in chat components

### 4. Updated Chat Components

**File**: `src/pages/chat/ChatPage.tsx`
- Imports and uses the `useNotifications` hook
- Calls `markChatAsRead()` when entering a chat to clear notifications

**File**: `src/components/chat/ChatListItem.tsx`
- Uses the synchronized notification system to mark chat notifications as read
- Removed direct database queries in favor of the hook-based approach

## How It Works

### When a Message is Sent:

1. Message is inserted into `chat_messages` table
2. Database trigger `on_chat_message_sent` fires automatically
3. Trigger creates a notification in the `notifications` table
4. The main notification system picks up the new notification via real-time subscription
5. Notification appears in the main notification bell
6. Chat indicator also updates its unread count independently

### When a Chat is Opened:

1. Chat messages are marked as read in the database
2. Chat-related notifications are marked as read via `markChatAsRead()`
3. Both the main notification bell and chat indicator update their counts
4. React Query cache is updated optimistically for immediate UI feedback

## Key Features

### ✅ Integrated Systems
- Chat notifications appear in the main notification dropdown
- Clicking chat notifications navigates to the correct chat
- Chat indicator remains separate but synchronized

### ✅ Real-time Updates
- New messages create instant notifications
- Opening chats immediately clears related notifications
- Both notification systems update in real-time

### ✅ Smart Navigation
- Chat notifications use `application_id` as `related_id`
- Notification dropdown uses `findChatByApplicationId` to navigate correctly
- Preserves existing navigation patterns

### ✅ User Experience
- No duplicate notifications - each message creates exactly one notification
- Notifications are automatically cleared when viewing chats
- Toast notifications appear for new messages
- Proper message truncation in notifications

## Benefits

1. **Unified Experience**: Users see all notifications in one place
2. **No Breaking Changes**: Existing chat functionality remains unchanged
3. **Performance**: Uses existing React Query caching and real-time subscriptions
4. **Maintainable**: Clean separation between chat and notification systems
5. **Scalable**: Database triggers ensure reliability even with high message volume

## Testing

To test the integration:

1. Have two users (brand and run club) with an accepted application
2. Send messages between them in the chat
3. Verify notifications appear in the main notification bell
4. Click notifications to ensure proper navigation
5. Confirm notifications are cleared when opening chats
6. Check that both notification systems update correctly

## Future Enhancements

- Could add notification preferences (enable/disable chat notifications)
- Could implement notification sounds for chat messages
- Could add support for group chats with multiple participants
- Could implement push notifications for mobile apps
